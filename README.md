# Genetic Algorithm made Right!

My first contact with this algorithm was at my first year on college. My professor sent us a task to solve the TSP (Traveller Salesman Problem) by any means we could find! Well, my college and I decided to search for methods on the internet, and then, GA came about. 

By that time, GA implementations was naive, we sought to implement every single feature, which actually worked a lot better than other approaches, but, because our lack of knowledge on the language (which was pure C) we couldnâ€™t get the best solution!

Even though we got a great result, I always sought to implement it right! Now, with my python skills very rooted, I decided to put in practice, that dream.
